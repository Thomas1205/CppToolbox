ANNOUNCEMENT: after the 1.15 release, the C++ toolbox will be C++-11, with many template exploitations

This package contains the following features, all written in C++

SIMPLE TYPES

- some basic typedefs and macros (makros.hh)

- a class for computations with rational numbers (rational.*), based on 64 bit integers for both numerator and denominator), with a check for overflow 
  (on a 64 bit operating system and if x86-AT&T assembler is supported).

DATA CLASSES

- template classes for 1, 2 and 3-dimensional containers, optionally with bound checks and object names stored as strings. 
  Plus container classes for a variable dimension size and for symmetric matrices.

- template classes for matrices, vectors and tensors, as an extension of the above containers. Includes saving matrices and tensors as PGMs or PPMs. 
  Furthermore, a basic matrix inversion (matrix_inversion.hh) and the calculation of matrix determinants (matrix_determinant.hh) are provided. 

- template classes for gray-level and color images including loading PGMs and PPMs (extensions of the above mathematical objects). 

- a generic application class to ease the parsing of command line arguments. This includes the specification of mandatory parameters 
  as well as default values. Filenames are checked for existence.

- sets in three variants: based on array trees, based on sorted arrays and based on unsorted arrays (with an extra variant exploiting sort when present).

- maps with plain keys: as sorted arrays and as unsorted arrays (with an extra variant exploiting sort when present).

- maps with hashing: as sorted hash arrays and as unsorted hash arrays (with an extra variant exploiting sort when present).

BASIC ROUTINES

- code for input-output of files (fileio.*) and standard objects such as vectors, sets and maps (stl_out.hh).

- some wrappers for using stl classes (stl_util.*).

- some basic string-processing routines including tokenization and downcasing (stringprocessing.hh)
  and conversion of strings into arbitrary types (makros.hh).

- cast abs, log, exp and pow into templates (makros.hh).

- upshift and downshift (routines.hh)

ALGORITHMS

- sorting algorithms (sorting.hh)

- find for 32 bit data types (routines.hh)

- reverse for 32 bit and 64 bit data types (routines.hh)

- binary search algorithms (routines.hh and stl_util.hh)

- some routines for combinatorics (combinatoric.hh), including choose(n,k), factorial, greatest common divisor, test of prime numbers, getting prime divisors
