This package contains the following features, all written in C++

- template classes for 1, 2 and 3-dimensional containers,
 optionally with bound checks and object names stored as strings.

- template classes for matrices, vectors and tensors,
as an extension of the above containers. Includes saving
matrices and tensors as PGMs or PPMs. Furthermore, a basic
matrix inversion is provided (matrix_inversion.hh)

- template classes for gray-level and color images including
loading PGMs and PPMs (extensions of the above mathematical objects). 

- code for input-output of files (fileio.hh/cc) and standard objects
such as vectors, sets and maps (stl_out.hh)

- some basic string-processing routines including tokenization (stringprocessing.hh)
and conversion of strings into arbitrary types (makros.hh)

- a generic application class to ease the parsing of command line arguments.
This includes the specification of mandatory parameters as well as default values.
Filenames are checked for existence.

- some basic typedefs and macros (makros.hh)



Sample application files to illustrate the usage of the features may
follow, sufficient interest provided.
