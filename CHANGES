/****** changes for version 1.01 *****/

- updated Makefile
- amendmend to README
- bugfix for tokenization with string separator
- improved handling of outputting typenames, including in convert<>
- moved comparison operators from vector to storage1D

/************** changes for version 1.0 *****/

- added FlexibleStorage1D, meant to replace std::vector with its push_back() functionality
- can now output the type of a container (makes debugging much easier)
- added operators for Storage1D
- improved Windows-compatibility when writing PGMs and PPMs (many thanks to Petter Strandmark)
- added a variable-dimension storage class
- introduced NamedStorage3D
- some smallish extensions
- added routines for the greatest common divisor
- extended stringprocessing, including handling of special characters when downcasing
- optimizations when resizing a storage1D
- added class Rational64
- size_t was replaced by a template parameter in 1/2/3-dimensional containers

/************** changes for version 0.925 **********/

- moved method set_constant() from Vector to Storage1D
- added template for outputting std::pair<t1,t2>

/************** changes for version 0.921 *********/
- included some files that were accidentally forgotten in 0.92

*************** changes for version 0.92 *********/
- Introduced an operator-=() for the tensor classes
- Introduced a class NamedStorage2D
- The tensor class has now a sum(x,y) and a min(x,y) method
- Improved Windows compatibility

*************** changes for version 0.91 *********/
- PGMs and PPMs are now written in binary mode as otherwise problems under Windows can occur.
  Many thanks to Petter Strandmark for pointing this out.
- The vector class has now template specializations of the copy constructor, based on memcpy
- The matrix and tensor classes have now template specializations of the operator=(), based on memcpy
- Introduced an operator-=() for the vector and matrix classes

*************** version 0.9 *********/
first released version
